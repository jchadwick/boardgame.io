/**
 * Game
 *
 * Helper to generate the game move reducer. The returned
 * reducer has the following signature:
 *
 * (G, action, ctx) => {}
 *
 * You can roll your own if you like, or use any Redux
 * addon to generate such a reducer.
 *
 * The convention used in this framework is to
 * have action.type contain the name of the move, and
 * action.args contain any additional arguments as an
 * Array.
 *
 * @param {...object} setup - Function that returns the initial state of G.
 *
 * @param {...object} moves - A dictionary of move functions.
 *
 * @param {...object} playerView - A function that returns a
 *                                 derivative of G tailored for
 *                                 the specified player.
 *
 * @param {...object} seed - Seed for the PRNG.
 *
 * @param {Array} plugins - List of plugins. Each plugin is an object like the following:
 *                          {
 *                            // Optional: Wraps a move / trigger function and returns
 *                            // the wrapped function. The wrapper can do anything
 *                            // it wants, but will typically be used to customize G.
 *                            fnWrap: (fn) => {
 *                              return (G, ctx, ...args) => {
 *                                G = preprocess(G);
 *                                G = fn(G, ctx, ...args);
 *                                G = postprocess(G);
 *                                return G;
 *                              };
 *                            },
 *
 *                            // Optional: Called during setup. Can be used to
 *                            // augment G with additional state during setup.
 *                            setup: (G, ctx) => G,
 *                          }
